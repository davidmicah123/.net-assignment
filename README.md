# How to Prepare Noodles

- Go to the kitchen.  
- Decide how many noodles you want to eat.  
- Pick the noodles.  
- Boil water in a pot, slightly more than the noodles would need.  
- Pour the noodles into the boiling water without breaking them.  
- Add all the ingredients and cover the pot.  
- After about 5 minutes, stir the noodles to prevent them from burning.  
- Taste the noodles to check if they are soft enough and ensure there is enough water in the mixture.  
- Turn off the gas once the noodles are soft enough.  
- Get a plate and dish the noodles.
